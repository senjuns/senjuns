This is a monorepo. The idea of a monorepo is to have all code related modules, documentation and so on next to each other. That allows to reduce the overhead when managing multiple repos. Please read the best practices when working in the repo.

[BEST_PRACTICES](wiki/BEST_PRACTICES.md)

## Setup

We use **yarn** as package manager and **node** for deploying locally. Please make sure to have node and yarn installed!

### Projen

The monorepo is managed using [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen).
