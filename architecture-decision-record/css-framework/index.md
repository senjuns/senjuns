## Summary

### Issue

We want to use a CSS framework to create our web applications:

- We want user experience to be fast and reliable, on all popular browsers and screen sizes.

- We want rapid iteration on design, layout, UI/UX, etc.

- We want responsive applications, especially for smaller screens such as on mobile devices, larger screens such as on 4K widescreens, and dynamic screens such as rotatable displays.

### Decision

Decided on styled-components.
Decided on material.

### Status

Decided on Bulma. Open to new CSS framework choices as they arrive.

## Details

### Assumptions

We want to create web apps that are modern, fast, reliable, responsive, etc.

Typical modern web apps are reducing/eliminating the use of jQuery because of multiple reasons:

- Modern JavaScript in phasing in many capabilities that jQuery has provided, so jQuery is less needed, and there are better/faster/smaller modules that provide specific implementations

- jQuery's broad approach is to do direct DOM manipulation, which is an anti-pattern for modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte)

- jQuery interferes with itself if it's loaded twice, etc.

### Constraints

If we choose a CSS framework that uses jQuery, then we're stuck importing jQuery. For example, Semantic UI uses jQuery, and Tachyons does not.

If we choose a CSS framework that is minimal, then we forego framework components that we may want now or soon. For example, Semantic UI provides an image carousel, and Tachyons does not.

### Positions

We considered using no framework. This still seems viable, especially because CSS grid provides much of what we need for our project..

We considered many CSS frameworks using a quick shortlist triage: Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation, Materialize, Semantic UI, Tachyons, etc. Our two selections for deeper review are Semantic UI (because it has the most-semantic approach) and Bulma (because it has the lightest-weight approach that provides the components we want now).

We considered Semantic UI. This provides many components, including ones we want for our project: tabs, grids, buttons, etc. We did a pilot with Semantic UI two ways: using typical CDN files, and using NPM repos. We achieved success with Semantic UI in a static HTML page, but did not achieve success within our timebox to build a JavaScript SPA (primarly because of jQuery load issues). We discovered that other coders have been asking the Semantic UI developers to create a jQuery-free version, for the same reasons we have. Other coders have been requesting a jQuery-free version for many years, yet the developers have said no, and stated that any jQuery-free version would be too hard to write e.g. ~"the Semantic UI project has more than 22,000 touchpoints that use jQuery".

Example with Semantic:

```html
<div class="ui top attached tabular menu">
  <a class="item">Alpha</a>
  <a class="item">Bravo</a>
</div>
```

We considered Bulma. Bulma has many similar capabilties as Semantic UI, although not as many sophisticated components. Bulma is built with modern techniques, such as no jQuery. Bulma has some third-party components, some of which we may want to use.

Example with Bulma:

```html
<div class="tabs">
  <ul>
    <li><a>Alpha</a></li>
    <li><a>Bravo</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Argument

As above.

Specifically, Semantic UI seems to have a caution flag both in terms of technology (i.e. so many jQuery touchpoints) and also in terms of leadership (i.e. jQuery-free was a hard no, rather than attemping a roadmap, or continous improvement, or donation fundraising, etc.).

### Implications

If we find a good non-jQuery CSS framework, this is generally helpful and good overall.

## Related

### Related decisions

The CSS framework we choose may affect testability.

### Related requirements

We want to ship a purely-modern app fast.

We do not want to spend time working on older frameworks (esp. Semantic UI) using older dependencies (esp. jQuery).

### Related artifacts

Affects all the typical HTML that will use the CSS.

### Related principles

Easily reversible.

Need for speed.
